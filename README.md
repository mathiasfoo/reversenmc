The Simulink file "hill_analytical_optimise_compare.slx" is used for comparison of the Base Circuit between the Hill function obtained analytically and through optimisation.

The Simulink file "linear_hill_compare.slx" is used for comparison of all three circuits between linear and Hill function model structures.

The folder "Solve Linear to Hill" contains all the files and functions required to map the linear model to Hill function model under different regulations (i.e., activation, inhibition, concurrent two activations and concurrent one inhibition and one activation. The main file is called "solve_linear_hill.m" whereas the remaining files in the folder are functions for reverse engineering different regulations.
